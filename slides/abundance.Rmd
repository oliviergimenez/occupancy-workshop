Detectability (usually) varies over time

---
# Background - Detectability issues

+ If $N$ is the abundance of a particular species at a particular study area

+ And $C$ the number of individuals counted in the field in this area

+ We have $E(C)=pN$

+ Where $p$ is the probability of counting an individual in the study area

---
# Background - Detectability issues

+ Eventually population abundance is given by:

$$N = \frac{C}{\alpha \times p}$$

+ $\alpha$ being the fraction of the study area that is sampled

+ *p* needs to be estimated to provide unbiased estimates 

+ And allows inference regarding abundance variations over time and space


---
# Sampling design

+ How to select sampling units in the study area to obtain unbiased estimates of abundance is a complex task

+ Need to define the statistical population of sample units and rely on some random selection process of the units to survey

+ Several sampling designs exist: Random, systematic, stratified, spatially balanced, etc

+ Not covered in this course

# Issue 1: Estimating abundance when $p<1$

+ Several methods exist, depending on whether population is "closed" or "open"

+ Closed populations: Capture-recapture, Distance sampling, N-mixture

+ Open populations: Capture-recapture, open N-mixture

+ In this course: 
 - Capture-recapture for closed populations
 - Distance sampling
 - N-mixture for closed populations

---
## What does "closed" populations mean?

+ Demographic closure:
  - no birth
  - no death
  
+ Geographic closure:
  - no immigration
  - no emigration
  
+ Between first and last field sessions

+ Implies to work over short time intervals 

+ 'Short' depending on species life history traits

## Capture-recapture methods for closed populations

Sample in a closed population
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Diapositive7.JPG")
```

---
## Capture-recapture methods for closed populations

Capture, mark and release some individuals (noted $n_1$)
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Diapositive8.JPG")
```
$p$ is typically below 1, not all present individuals are captured (here $p \approx 1/3$)
---
## Capture-recapture methods for closed populations

Make a second visit, capture a second independent sample of individuals
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Diapositive10.JPG")
```
Among newly captured individuals, noted $n_2$, some are marked, noted $m$, others aren't 

---
## Capture-recapture methods for closed populations

+ The proportion of marked individuals after the first sample is $\displaystyle{\frac{n_1}{N}}$

+ The proportion of marked individuals in the second sample is $\displaystyle{\frac{m}{n_2}}$

+ Assuming sampling sessions are independent (individuals have equal detection probability whether they have already been captured or not)

+ Then the proportion of marked individuals in the second sample, *m*, is the proportion of marked individuals in the entire population:

$$\hat{N}=\displaystyle{\frac{n_1 \times n_2}{m}}$$
---
## Capture-recapture methods for closed populations

Another way of writing the Lincoln-Petersen index


$n_{10}=N \times p_1 \times (1-p_2)$

$n_{01}=N \times (1-p_1) \times p_2$

$n_{11}=N \times p_1 \times p_2$

with $p_1$ and $p_2$ the capture probability at first and second session respectively

3 equations, 3 unknown values N, $p_1, p_2, \ldots$, no difficulties


---
## Capture-recapture methods for closed populations

Rearranging the equations also leads to: 

$$N=\displaystyle{\frac{n_{10}+n_{01}+n_{11}}{1 - (1-p_1) \times (1-p_2)}}$$
or  

$$N=\displaystyle{\frac{n_{10}+n_{01}+n_{11}}{p*}}$$

with $p*$ the probability to be captured at least once and ${n_{10}+n_{01}+n_{11}}$ the total number of different individuals captured

*Remember* $$N = \frac{C}{p}$$

# Lincoln-Petersen assumptions 2

Population is closed demographically and geographically

---
# Lincoln-Petersen assumptions 3

Population is closed demographically and geographically

---
# Lincoln-Petersen and then ?

Population is closed demographically and geographically

**All individuals are equally likely to be caught in each sample**

Marks are not lost (or unobserved)

Several sources of variation in capture:
  - time - t (weather, sampling effort)
  - behavior - b (trap-effect)
  - individual heterogenity - h (age, sex, social status)
  
... and combination of these effects

To test these effects, we need more than 2 sessions

---
# More than two sessions - capture histories

Each line = one individual / each column = one field session
```{r echo = FALSE}
hist<-c('1011','0110','1010','...','...','1101')
texte<-c('seen first session, not seen second session, seen third and fourth session',
         'not seen first session, seen second and third session, not seen fourth session','','','','')

```
---
# More than two sessions - assumptions

Population is closed demographically and geographically

Marks are not lost and individuals are identified without error

All individuals are equally likely to be caught in each sample 


---
# More than two sessions - capture histories

The $M_0$ model - constant detection probability (among individuals, among sessions)

Generalisation of Lincoln-Petersen index to more than two sessions

```{r echo = FALSE}

proba<-c('ppp','pp(1-p)','p(1-p)p','p(1-p)(1-p)','(1-p)pp','(1-p)p(1-p)','(1-p)(1-p)p','(1-p)(1-p)(1-p)')
tableproba<-data.frame(History=hist,Probability=proba)
knitr::kable(tableproba)
```

---
# Maximum likelihood

+ The number of individuals with history 111 is provided by $n_{111}=N \times p \times p \times p$

+ We can do that for all histories, remember the equations we wrote for the Lincoln-Petersen index

+ Solving the equation system becomes more and more challenging as the number of field sessions increases 

+ Then using an algorithm called "maximum likelihood" we can search for the values of p and N that lead to the closest match between the number of observed histories ( $n_{111}$, $n_{110}$, etc) and their expected number given $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{N}$

---
# More than two sessions

+ The $M_0$ model is very constrained, possible to relax some assumptions

+ $M_t$ = Variation over time of detection probabilities

+ $M_b$ = Capture and recapture can be different (trap-dependence)


---
# Model Mt

+ Capture probabilities vary with session (weather conditions, field effort, observer experience, etc)

# Model with heterogeneity

+ Capture can depend on several unknown variables (age, sexe, social status, etc)

+ Each individual as a unique capture probability

+ $N+1$ parameters to estimate: $N, p_i$ with $i=1, 2, \ldots, N$

+ This model has too many parameters, we can use Pledger's mixture models

---
# Pledger's mixture model

+ Assume individuals belong to two groups with different capture probabilities

+ A proportion $\pi$ belongs to the first group with capture probability $p_H$

+ And $(1-\pi)$ to the second group with $p_L$

+ Then $p=\pi \times p_H + (1-\pi) \times p_L$

+ We can just use this equation in $M_0$ and get four parameters: $N, \pi, p_H$ and $p_L$



---
# More complex models

+ Combining different effects: $M_{bt}, M_{bh}, M_{th}$

+ Use some individuals covariates: Age, sex, body conditions, etc


---
# Model selection

+ We can fit several models, each returning a different $\hat{N}$

+ How to select for the one that is the best given the data ? 

+ The most complex models are always the one that explain best the data (increase explained variance)

+ Yet sometimes the complexification yields to only very small improvement of explained variance

+ Idea: **penalize models with too many parameters**

---
# Akaike information criterion (AIC)

$$AIC = Deviance + 2 K$$

+ with $Deviance$, a measure of the unexplained variance of the model 

+ $K$ the number of parameters in the model

+ AIC makes the balance between *quality of fit* and *complexity* of a model

+ Best model is the one with lowest AIC value

*Note that two models are difficult to distinguish if $\Delta \text{AIC} < 2$*

---
# Some thoughts on closure assumption

+ Some tests of closure exist (Otis et al 1978, Stanley and Burnham 1999), available in R (package "secr")

+ Yet very sensitive to other sources of variations such as capture heterogeneity

+ Low performance when p is low

+ Some authors now rely more on ecological justification than statistical tests

## Estimating density and abundance using counts (1)

+ Using raw counts in the sample strips/circles

+ Density is easily estimated using: 

$$\hat{D}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n{a_i}}$$

+ With $y_i$ the count at each sample unit, and $a_i$ the surface of each sample unit

+ That can be translated into abundance $N$ with: 
$$\hat{N} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{\alpha}$$

+ Where $\alpha$ is the the proportion of the study area eventually sampled

# Distance sampling - background (1)

+ Distance sampling rational was formulated by Steve Buckland, early 1980

+ The number of detections tends to decrease with distance to observer...

+ ...some information on detection probability is encapsulated in distances

+ Can we estimate detection probability by recording the distances of detected individuals rather than their presence only ?

# Estimating density when detection < 1

# Modelling the detection function (1)

+ $g(y)$, detection probability given the distance, needs to be estimated

+ $g(y)$ is not known and may vary a lot due to observer experience and environment

+ Distance sampling strategy is to go for a few models for $g(y)$ with good properties:

    - model robustness
    - shape criterion
    - efficiency


---
# Modelling the detection function (2)

+ Model robustness

    - General function that can take a variety of shapes

    - Robust w.r.t. pooling

+ Shape criterion 

    - A ‚Äúshoulder‚Äù near the transect line (detection approx. 1 around the line / point)

+ Efficiency 

    - Provides precise estimates ‚Äì use Maximum Likelihood

---
# Modelling the detection function (3)

Two components for $g(y)$:

- A ‚Äòkey‚Äô function: Uniform, half-normal, hazard-rate

- A ‚Äòseries‚Äô expansion: Cosine, simple polynomial, hermite polynomial

# Three critical assumptions

- Individuals on the line or point are all detected $g(0)=1$

- Individuals are detected at their initial location

- Distances are recorded accurately

---
# Individuals on the line or point are all detected

If $g(0)$ is below 1 and unknown, density is underestimated by an unknown factor

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Diapositive29.JPG")
```

---
# Individuals on the line or point are all detected

+ Possible to estimate $g(0)$ using two or more independent observers or radiotracked individuals

+ Ensure $g(0)=1$ using cameras, trained pointing dogs, but be aware of potential bias

+ Use more recent modelling approach, e.g. distance sampling with temporary emigration (requires repeated surveys in the same sampling unit)


---
## Individuals are detected at their initial location

+ Assumption 2: Animals do not move before detection (snapshot)

+ Effect of violation: 
     
     - Random movements induce positive bias; provided object movement is slow relative to movement of the observer, bias is small
     - Responsive movements can cause large bias; positive if there is attraction to the observer, negative if there is avoidance

+ Recommendations: 
    
    - In point transects, wait once on site before proceeding
    - In line transects, look well ahead


---
# Measures are recorded accurately

+ Assumption 3: Distances are measured accurately

+ Effect of violation: 
      
      - The estimator is fairly robust to random errors in measurement
      - It is sensitive to extreme outliers and to rounding distances

+ Recommendations:

     - If exact measurements are difficult, use intervals (group data)
     - If outliers, use truncation (5-10% of the largest observations)
     - If heaping (convenient ‚Äòrounding‚Äô), use intervals and choose cutpoints such that ‚Äúheaps‚Äù are at the midpoint of an interval
     - Accurate measurement is most effective solution, so use appropriate tools (tape measures; laser range finders; compass for angles)

---
# Goodness-of-fit tests

+ We need to verify that the fit of the model makes sense

+ Several diagnostics and tests have been developed (QQplot, Chi-square tests, etc), depends on whether data are continuous or in classes of distance

+ The general principle is to verify that there is no large decrepancy between the prediction from the fitted model and the raw data

---
# Line or point transects ?

Point transects are:
- Relevant for populations distributed in patches
- Convenient to use when the area is difficult to access / survey
- Naturally suited for stratification

Line transects are:
- Efficient for sparsely distributed populations
- Effective in low densities

# Count on a fixed sample area

+ Traditional methods = count animals (or plants) along transects of fixed width
or on quadrat, or on circular plots

+ These counts are affected by detection issues

# Repeated counts with imperfect detection

+ When counts are repeated on the same sampling unit, some variations are observed

+ This is due to random process related to imperfect detection

+ Example: sex-ratio in humans is close to 0.5

    - Probability to have a son is therefore 0.5
    - Expected number of sons in four siblings is 2
    - Yet some parents have four sons and zero daughters

---
# Repeated counts with imperfect detection

+ Example: true abundance is 5, detection probability is 0.5

+ Repeated counts on the same unit with imperfect detection leads to variations

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Diapositive34.JPG")
```

+ Repeated counts on the same units encapsulate information on detection and abundance

---
# N-mixture models (Royle 2004)

+ N-mixture models take advantage of these variations between counts at the same sample unit

+ Requires some spatial replications (several sampling units) and temporal replications (repeated counts at the same units) - same design as *site occupancy models*

+ Some strong assumptions:

    - Abundance at a sampling unit does not change between successive counts ("closed population")
    - Individuals have the same detection probability (no heterogeneity)
    - Abundances at the sampling units are Poisson distributed
    - Sampling sessions are independent (no trap-dependence)

# N-mixture models (Royle 2004)

Typical dataset used for N-mixture models

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
set.seed(254)
xinit<-rpois(10,3)
hist<-matrix(0,nrow=10,ncol=3)
for (i in 1:10)
{
  if (xinit[i]>0){hist[i,]<-rbinom(3,xinit[i],0.5)}
  
}
tt<-data.frame(site = seq(1:10), counts = hist)
knitr::kable(tt, format = 'html')
```

# N-mixture models formulation

+ N-mixture can be formulated as hierarchical models

+ A state process describing the system 

$$N_i \sim \mbox{Poisson}(\lambda)$$
with $\lambda$ the mean abundance at the sites

+ An observation process corresponding to detection issues

$$y_{it} \sim \mbox{Binomial}(N_i,p)$$

+ Covariates can be added on abundance (e.g. vegetation cover, elevation) and on detection probability (e.g. vegetation cover, date, observer experience)

---
# N-mixture models - to use with caution

+ The method has been highly controversial for years

+ Couturier et al. 2013 - Identifiability problems when $p$ is low or highly variable

+ Barker et al. 2017 - Without auxillary information about $p$, count data cannot distinguish between N-mixture model or other possible models of $N$

+ Dennis 2015, K√©ry 2017 - Some parameters not identifiable especially with negative binomial distribution instead of Poisson  

+ Link et al. 2018 - Estimates sensitive to violation of double counting and constant $\lambda / p$ - GOF unable to detect this

+ Conclusion: check parameter $K$ (see live demo), perform GOF, do not rely on negative binomial distribution
